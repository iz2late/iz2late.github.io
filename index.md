## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [UKRI CDT in NLP](https://nlp-cdt.ac.uk/) at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), advised by [Prof. Frank Keller](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/) and [Prof. Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). I am also a member of the [Edinburgh NLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) of [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/).
I interned at [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.science/tag/amazon-prime-video) in 2024 and [Huawei Edinburgh Research Center](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/he-lab/) in 2021.

My research interests lie at the intersection of language and vision, specifically on:
- Controllable and visually-grounded text generation from visual input
- Reasoning and distillation in large vision-language models (VLMs)
- Understanding, generation, and evaluation of stories and narrative texts

**Seeking postdoc or industry research roles in the UK for 2025. Please reach out with opportunities!**
